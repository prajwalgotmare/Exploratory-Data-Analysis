# Sample Super Store Exploratory Data Analysis

This project aims to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Sample Super Store dataset. The dataset contains sales data for a fictional retail company and includes columns for Ship Mode, Segment, Country, City, State, Postal Code, Region, Category, Sub-Category, Sales, Quantity, Discount, and Profit.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to gain insights into the sales data and understand the patterns and relationships between various columns. We will be using visualization techniques and statistical analysis to achieve this.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation

Before performing the EDA, it is necessary to clean and prepare the data. This includes handling missing values, converting data types, and removing any outliers that may skew the results.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The EDA process will involve the following steps:

- Univariate Analysis: Analysis of individual columns to understand the distribution of data.
- Bivariate Analysis: Analysis of the relationship between two columns.
- Multivariate Analysis: Analysis of the relationship between multiple columns.

We will be using visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to better understand the relationships between columns.

## Results

The results of the EDA will be summarized in a report that highlights the important insights and patterns discovered in the data. This report will also include recommendations for further analysis.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive EDA of the Sample Super Store dataset. The results of the EDA can be used to make informed business decisions and improve the sales strategy of the retail company.
